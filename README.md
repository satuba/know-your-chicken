# know-your-chicken

This target of project is to build a website that's going to list different brands of chicken and eggs, and tell more information about them. 

List of information the website will provide:
- organic
- genetically engineerd
- use of antibiotics
- living conditions of the chicken/ free range
- responsively raised
- environmental sustainability
- preservatives
- hormones
- local

You are able to search for the specific information that you need. For example, you can search for only antibiotic-free chicken and the site will provide the information. 

The website also provides links to articles and videos.
