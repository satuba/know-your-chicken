# know-your-chicken

The target of this project is to build a website that's going to list different brands of chicken and eggs and provide information regarding each brands's quality for consumers concerned about the food they eat. 

Qualities of each brand of chicken or egg being investigated:
- organic?
- genetically engineered?
- use of antibiotics?
- use of hormones?
- living conditions of the chicken/ free range?
- humanely raised?
- natural diet?

You are able to search for the specific information that you need. For example, you can search for only antibiotic-free chicken and the site will provide the information. Specifc brands are also searchable.

The website also provides links to articles and videos for more information regarding chicken and egg qualities.
